\section{Introduction}

\section{Description of task}
The Scortec ER-I is a 5-DOF manipulator from Eshed Robotec. The
control box is missing and a new controller is needed. For this
purpose, the Arduino Due board and a motor shield is used. \\

Figure \ref{fig:axes} shows a description of the axes on the manipulator.

\end{figure}

The task of creating a controller for the manipulator involves the
following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reverse engineer the motor and encoder connections and make a
  pinout diagram for the D50 connector on the manipulator.
\item Program the microcontroller to read the encoders.
\item Write control routines for position and velocity control.
\item Extend the control routines to more than one joint.
\end{enumerate}

The following sections describe each of these tasks and challenges
faced while executing them.

\section{Reverse Engineering}

In this task, we set out to map the pins on the D50 connector to the
individual motors and encoders. Once the pin-out diagram was in place
we could connect the Arduino and read the encoder pins. However, we
faced some problems while reading encoder outputs. The following
sections describe each of these tasks in detail. \\

\subsection{Pinout}
The primary task was to figure out the what each pin on the D50
connector meant. For this task we first took one motor and used the
multimeter to test for continuity. \\

The encoder board has 6 pins but only 4 had corresponding pins on the
D50 connector, and the motor had two corresponding pins (one positive
and one negative). \\

The figure below shows the pinouts for the D50 connector.
